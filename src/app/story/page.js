            <h2> Elaine & Marcel </h2>
            <p>Elaine, a Le Cordon Bleu graduate with a flair for innovative flavors, and Marcel, winner of the prestigious &#34;Best Baguette in Paris&#34; award, combined their talents to open a tiny bakery in Montmartre. Their little shop quickly became the talk of the town, earning a coveted Michelin star within its first year. Locals and tourists alike lined up daily for Marcel&#39;s heavenly baguettes and Elaine&#39;s creative Ã©clairs.</p>

            <p> Dreaming of new adventures, the couple decided to bring a taste of Paris across the Atlantic. They packed their rolling pins, secret recipes, and an unshakeable passion for French baking. In a cozy corner of their new American home, Elaine and Marcel opened Le Petit Croissant. Here, they continue to sprinkle a bit of French magic into their community, delighting patrons with authentic flavors and warm hospitality. </p>
